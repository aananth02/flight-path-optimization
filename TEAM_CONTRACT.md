# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 


Our team will meet twice in a week. One would be a flexible date based on all our availabilites and the second time we meet would be on Saturday from 3:30pm - 5:30pm. We will be meeting in-person at the grainger library. We will be taking notes and writing to-do's on our individual devices.

2. **Assistance** 

We have shared our numbers with each other and our source of communication would be Whatsapp. Everyone is expected to respond as soon as possible (within 3-4hours).

3. **Respect** 

We will ensure that every member stays respectful with each other by promoting open communication. We discussed that we will talk about every issue as soon as it comes up and would keep our minds open to various ideas and proposals.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

We will be assigning workload equally based on each individual's strenghts. We have talked about the areas we all are comfortable with and the areas we arent. We planned that two people can work on one subfunction and to maximise learning we decided that from those two people one would be a person who feels confident with that domain and the other member would be not as confident. This is so that we all can go out of our comfort zones and learn new things. We will address unexpected complications/ unforeseen work together as a group. We will work together to get through any complcation that arises. We also promote asking for help so our group members can feel comfortable asking any help they need. Along with that we will be using online learning resources to learn things none of us have experience in.


5. **Time Commitment** 

Around 5-8 hours of work per week is expected of each group member. There arent any prior time commitments that need to be accounted for. We will address new conflicts and committments by being understanding of the other persons conflicts and will try to distribute work when something inevitably occurs.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

Our team's core value is communication. Whenever any conflict will come up or any team member does not do their work properly, we will talk about it with that team member and try to understand what happeneded and why it happened. We will collectively work on how to fix it. Aftet 2-3 reminders if the situation still stays the same, we will inform the course staff.
